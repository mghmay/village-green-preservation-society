## All is well in the sleepy little hamlet of Little Whinging on the Wold

This was a project for codecademy which involved creating a site for a local society or club. I decided to make up a village green society which focused on having tea parties, amongst other things.

## Nifty stuff

I used a wider variety of fonts and colours for this challenge deciding to make the different sections really pop. I did most of it in flexbox as i felt less comfortable using it so needed the practice. I also made the top banner hidden for media devices and a button appear on the navbar. I like this style of scaling

## To be improved

I could have used more javascript to make it more interactive. I probably should have kept it plainer with less personality but what can I say? **_soy yo_**.
